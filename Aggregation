ðŸŸ¨ Problem 3
Aggregation
Problem Statement
In the job_postings_fact table calculate the total sum of the average yearly salary (salary_year_avg) 
for all job postings that are marked as fully remote and divide it by the total count of salary_year_avg. 
To get the total average yearly salary for fully remote jobs. Ensure to only include job postings 
where a yearly salary is specified (salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL).

SELECT 
    SUM(salary_year_avg)/COUNT(salary_year_avg) AS avg_salary_ft

Aggregation
Problem Statement
In the job_postings_fact table, find the minimum and maximum yearly salaries (salary_year_avg) 
offered for job postings in locations that include â€˜San Franciscoâ€™ in the location title. 
The query should return two columns: one for the minimum yearly salary and one for the maximum yearly salary, 
considering only job postings that specify a yearly salary (salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL).

SELECT

-- UNION Operators
-- Problem Statement
-- Create a unified query that categorizes job postings into two groups: 
-- those with salary information (salary_year_avg or salary_hour_avg is not null) 
-- and those without it. Each job posting should be listed with its job_id, job_title, 
-- and an indicator of whether salary information is provided.

from job_postings_fact
where salary_year_avg is not NULL or salary_hour_avg is not NULL

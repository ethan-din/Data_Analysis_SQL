-- ðŸŸ© Problem 1
-- Operations
-- Problem Statement
-- In the invoices_fact table, multiply the hours_spent to the hours_rate and rename this new column to added_value.
-- Order by activity_id in ascending order.
-- Note: This is calculating the total pay based on a particular activity_id.

SELECT 
	hours_spent,
    hours_rate,
    activity_id,
    hours_rate*hours_spent AS added_value
FROM invoices_fact
ORDER BY activity_id

ðŸŸ© Problem 2
Operations
Problem Statement
In the invoices_fact table divide the hours_spent by the hours_rate and rename this column to efficiency_ratio. 
Return the activity_id as well. Order by activity_id in ascending order.

SELECT 
    activity_id,
    hours_spent / hours_rate AS efficiency_ratio
FROM invoices_fact
ORDER BY activity_id

ðŸŸ¨ Problem 3
Operations
Problem Statement
In the invoices_fact table, suppose each project has a fixed budget cap. Youâ€™re told the budget cap is $100,000 for every activity.

Subtract the actual cost of the activity (calculated as hours_spent * hours_rate) from the budget cap to find how much budget is left. 
Name this new column remaining_budget.

Return the activity_id and remaining_budget, and order the results by activity_id in ascending order.

SELECT 
    activity_id,
    100000-hours_spent * hours_rate AS remaining_budget
FROM invoices_fact
ORDER BY activity_id

ðŸŸ¨ Problem 4
Operations
Problem Statement
In the invoices_fact table, each activity has a base cost calculated as hours_spent * hours_rate. 
Assume a flat travel fee of $150 is charged per activity.

Add this flat fee to the base cost, and name the resulting column total_cost_with_travel.
Return the activity_id and total_cost_with_travel, ordered by activity_id in ascending order.

SELECT 
    activity_id,
    150+hours_spent * hours_rate AS total_cost_with_travel
FROM invoices_fact
ORDER BY activity_id

-- Problem Statement
-- Identify companies with the most diverse (unique) job titles. 
-- Use a CTE to count the number of unique job titles per company, 
-- then select companies with the highest diversity in job titles.

ðŸŸ¨ Problem 2
CTEs
Problem Statement
Explore job postings by listing job id, job titles, company names, 
and their average salary rates, while categorizing these salaries relative to the average 
in their respective countries. Include the month of the job posted date. 
Use CTEs, conditional logic, and date functions, to compare individual salaries with national averages.

ðŸŸ¥ Problem 3
CTEs
Problem Statement
Calculate the number of unique skills required by each company. 
Aim to quantify the unique skills required per company and identify which of 
these companies offer the highest average salary for positions necessitating at least one skill. 
For entities without skill-related job postings, list it as a zero skill requirement and a null salary. 
Use CTEs to separately assess the unique skill count and the maximum average salary offered by these companies.
